## Experiment 1

There were significant effects of forced treadmill exercise on cumulative food intake (0–1 h, F3,103 = 78.809, P < 0.01, 0–2 h, F3,103 = 151.865, P < 0.0001, and 0–3 h F3,103 = 223.108, P < 0.001). Fig. 1 shows that all three intensities of forced exercise, 32.5, 54 and 75.8 m/ min, significantly decreased cumulative food intake at 1, 2, and 3 h postexercise compared to the no exercise (P < 0.05). There were significant decreases in food intake for exercise at 54 m/min and exercise at 75.8 m/min, compared to exercise at 32.5 m/min at 1, 2 and 3 h post-exercise (p < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences in food intake between exercise at 54 m/min and exercise at 75.8 m/min at 1 and 2 h post-exercise (P > 0.05). The maximum numerical decrease in food intake was observed for exercise at 54 m/min. Cumulative food intake for no exercise, exercise at 32.5 m/min, exercise at 54 m/min, and exercise at 75.8 m/min were 6.2 ± 0.2 g, 3.6 ± 0.1 g, 2.5 ± 0.1 g and 2.9 ± 0.1 g, respectively (Fig. 1).

## Experiment 2
Forced treadmill exercise at 54 m/min induced significant c-Fos activation in the CeA, the CPu, the dBNST, and the PVN, VMH, DMH and LH (P < 0.05). But did not induce significant c-Fos activity in the FC. Table 1 shows the extent of c-Fos activation by brain site. Fig. 2 shows the effects of no exercise and exercise at 54 m/min on c-Fos expression in the PVN and in the CeA. Fig. 3 provides representative photomicrographs of c-Fos positive staining relative to no exercise and forced exercise in the PVN and in the CeA. The extent of c-Fos activation is clearly visible in the forced exercise sections.
