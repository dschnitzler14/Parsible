## About Parsible

Parsible is a teaching-focused web app designed to help students learn how to read scientific papers effectively.

- understanding paper structure
- developing reading strategies
- learning how to interpret figures and methods
- developing critical reading skills

It is intended for use in undergraduate and postgraduate teaching, journal clubs, and self-guided study.
