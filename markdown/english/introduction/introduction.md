## Welcome: How to Read a Scientific Paper

Are you feeling overwhelmed by scientific papers? Are you unsure where to start, what to focus on, or how to understand the key points?

Reading primary scientific literature, also called research papers or journal articles, is a core skill for university study. It is essential for undergraduate students, postgraduate students, and educators teaching research methods, critical thinking, and evidence-based practice. If no one has ever shown you how to read a scientific paper, it can feel confusing and time-consuming.

This app is here to help you learn and practice reading papers!

Instead of giving you a full paper and expecting you to figure it out alone, this app teaches you a practical step-by-step method for reading a scientific paper efficiently and confidently. You will learn how to read a research article, understand scientific terminology, identify the hypothesis, interpret results, and evaluate how strong the evidence is.
