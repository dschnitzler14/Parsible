The title of the paper is supposed to be informative and clear. It is not uncommon to have extremely long and precise titles in science. For example:

<div style="
  border-left: 6px solid #0d6efd;
  background-color: #f1f6ff;
  padding: 14px 16px;
  margin: 16px 0;
  border-radius: 6px;
">
<strong>📄 Example of scientific paper titles</strong>
<ul style="margin-top: 8px;">
  <li><em>Genome-wide association analyses identify 44 risk variants and refine the genetic architecture of major depression</em></li>
  <li><em>Lycium barbarum polysaccharide attenuates emotional injury of offspring elicited by prenatal chronic stress in rats via regulation of gut microbiota</em></li>
</ul>
</div>

Titles are descriptive and help the reader identify what the study was about. Usually they will include the model organism that was used (e.g. "rats").

<div style="
  border-left: 4px solid #f0ad4e;
  background-color: #fff8e5;
  padding: 12px;
  margin: 16px 0;
">
⚠️ <strong>Warning:</strong> Some titles can be exaggerated or point to the authors' interpretation, not what they actually found.
