When in doubt, ask yourself: Did this idea, method, tool, or material originate with me? If not, it probably needs a citation.

You should cite:

- Methods
  If you are using an established protocol or analytical approach developed by someone else, cite the original paper (or a standard reference describing it).

- Figures or tables
  If you reproduce or adapt a figure or table from another source, you must cite it clearly and follow copyright or licensing requirements.

- R or Python packages
  Software packages should be cited, especially in scientific work. Many packages provide a preferred citation. This acknowledges the developers and improves reproducibility.

- Datasets
  If you use publicly available data, cite the dataset and, if applicable, its DOI.

- Theories, models, and frameworks
  If they were developed by others, they require citation.

- Other scientific studies
  If you are describing the outcomes of previously published studies, you must cite the authors of those papers.
