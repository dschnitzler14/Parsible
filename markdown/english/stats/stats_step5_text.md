    Main Concept
  </div>
    We cannot usually measure an entire population, so we use a sample to estimate the true population parameter which is the real value that describes everyone. Because different samples would give slightly different results, we use confidence intervals to show the range of plausible values for that unknown parameter.

    <h4>What is a confidence interval?</h4>
    A range of values calculated from sample data that is likely to contain the true population parameter.

  <div class="ps-tile">
    <h4>When should you use it?</h4>
    When you want to estimate the size of an effect and show the uncertainty around that estimate

    <h4>How to interpret it</h4>
    The interval shows the range of values that are compatible with your data. Narrow intervals indicate greater precision; wide intervals indicate more uncertainty. If the interval excludes the null value, the result is statistically significant.
