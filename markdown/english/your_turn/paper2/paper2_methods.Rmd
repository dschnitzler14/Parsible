## Experiment 1: effect of exercise intensity on food intake

### Animals
Twenty-four male Sprague–Dawley rats (Harlan, UK), weighing 250–275 g, were housed individually in stainless steel hanging cages with the temperature in the vivarium maintained at 22 ◦C under a reversed 12 h light/12 h dark cycle (lights on at 21:00 h), with dark phase procedures conducted under red light conditions. Subjects were given ad libitum access to water and standard laboratory diet (Rodent Chow, Harlan, UK). Food intake was measured daily at 0900 h, 1000 h, 1100 h and at 1200 h. When mean food intake between 0900 h and 1000 h reached 4–5 g (approximately two weeks of adaptation to the light cycle) the experiment began. All procedures were performed in compliance with the regulations and guidelines of the Animal Care and Ethical Review Body and were conducted in accordance with the United Kingdom Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, approved by the institutional ethical review committee and performed under Home Office Project Licence (UK).

### Apparatus
A treadmill (in-house design and manufacture) consisted of a 15 mm thick clear plastic outer support framework with aluminium angle corners 31 cm high, 73 cm long and 68 cm wide. A rubberised running belt was divided by 15 cm high partitions to create five lanes. Each lane was 65 cm long and 10.5 cm wide. The track speed was controlled by variable speed drive rollers, and a revolution counter on the track lead return roller was used to record and regulate exercise intensity.

### Procedure
Following the two-week adaptation to the light cycle, the treadmill exercise data collection began at 0900 h each day. Subjects (n = 24) were randomly assigned to two groups (Group 1 and Group 2, 12 per group). On day 1 each subject in Group 1 was exposed to forced exercise at 32.5 m/min and each subject in Group 2 was placed in a holding cage. On day 2 each subject in Group 2 was exposed to forced exercise at 32.5 m/min and each subject in Group 1 was placed in a holding cage. On day 3 each subject in Group 1 was exposed to forced exercise at 54 m/min and each subject in Group 2 was placed in a holding cage. On day 4 each subject in Group 2 was exposed to forced exercise at 54 m/min and each subject in Group 1 was placed in a holding cage. On day 5 each subject in Group 1 was exposed to forced exercise at 75.8 m/min and each subject in Group 2 was placed in a holding cage. On day 6 each subject in Group 2 was exposed to forced exercise at 75.8 m/min and each subject in Group 1 was placed in a holding cage. This series of procedures was then repeated. Each day following exercise or no exercise all rats were returned to their home cages where pre-weighed chow pellets had been placed, and food intake was measured at 1, 2 and 3 h intervals and corrected for spillage.

## Experiment 2: effect of forced exercise on c-Fos expression in specific brain areas
### Procedure
The rats were randomly assigned to exercise (n = 12) and no exercise (n = 12). The exercise rats were exposed to forced exercise at 54 m/min and the no exercise rats were placed in individual holding cages. Following exercise or no exercise all rats were returned to their home cages for 30 min, then sacrificed for histology.

### Histology
Subjects were anaesthetized with 60 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital and perfused through the ascending aorta with 400 ml 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH7.4), followed by 500 ml ice cold 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were then removed and post-fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4 ◦C, and then placed in 10 % sucrose in PBS. Fixed brains were then cut at 40 μm using a cryostat, placed in cryoprotectant solution, and stored at -20 ◦C until immunohistochemistry. Storing tissue in this manner preserves antigenicity and morphology for up to 90 days. For c-Fos immunohistochemistry, sections were placed in 24-well tissue culture plates and rinsed 4 × 10 min in 0.1 M tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.4). Sections were treated with 3 % H2O2 in 10 % methanol in TBS for 10 mins. After 4 × 10 min rinses with TBS sections were incubated with primary antibody (c-Fos 1:10,000 dilution, Santa Cruz, USA) in 0.0025 % gelatine and 0.5 % Triton-X in 100 ml of TBS for 48 hrs at 4 ◦C. After incubation with the Fos antiserum, sections were processed through 4 × 10 mins rinses of TBS and incubated for 1 h with biotinylated rabbit anti-goat immunoglobulin G (1:400 dilution, Ector, UK) at room temperature. After 3 × 10 min rinses with TBS, the sections were incubated with avidin-biotin complex (1:500 dilution, Elite ABC reagent, Vector) for 1 h at room temperature. After 3 × 10 min rinses with TBS, sections were placed in a solution containing 0.05 % 3,3′-diaminobenzidene tetrahydrochloride, 0.007 % nickel sulphate, and 0.006 % hydrogen peroxide for 5 mins for visualisation. After 3 × 10 min rinses with TBS, sections were mounted on gelatinised slides, dehydrated, left overnight and then coverslipped with Permount mounting medium (Vector, UK).

### Quantification of c-Fos expression
Sections were viewed using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 plus microscope, and images were captured using a Zeiss AxioCam HRc, which was linked to a PC. AxioVision 3.0 was employed to analyse the images. All immunoreactive cells contained within the anatomical area of interest were counted using a telly counter. The co-ordinates of all areas examined were determined according to the atlas of Paxinos and Watson [95]. The specific co-ordinates were CPu (-0.26 to -0.40 mm), dBNST (-0.26 to -0.30 mm), PVN (-1.6 to -2.21 mm), LH (-1.8 to -2.21 mm), DMH (-2.56 to -3.14 mm), VMH (-2.56 to -3.30 mm), CeA (-2.30 to -2.80 mm), and FC (1.60 to 1.20 mm) relative to bregma.

### Data analysis and statistics
Shapiro-Wilks tests were conducted to confirm normality of distribution. Food intake data were analysed using a repeated measures oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc analysis by Bonferroni correction at each time point. Activation of c-Fos-IR was determined using Student’s t-test. Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM.
