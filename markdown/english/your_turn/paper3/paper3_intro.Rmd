Despite the common perception that feeding behaviour and anxiety are interrelated, the exact nature of that relationship remains poorly defined.

On the one hand, a growing body of evidence supports the notion that fasting is associated with improved mood and reduced anxiety. For example, fasting with caloric restriction (CR) resulted in decreased tension, anger, confusion and mood disturbance in older men. Conversely, the hyperphagia condition Prader–Willi syndrome is commonly associated with heightened anxiety. More detailed knowledge of this relationship has emerged from preclinical studies, where acute CR and time-restricted feeding have been reported to reduce anxiety in male and female rats, and elevate basal corticosterone levels without augmenting stress-induced hypothalamo–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis activation. While the antidepressant impact of CR may be mediated in part by orexin, the anxiolytic impact may be dependent upon the activation of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) by the gastric hormone ghrelin, potentially via augmentation of vagal sensory signals. Conversely, it is also evident that central ghrelin treatment may be anxiogenic.

Evidence that anxiety influences feeding behaviour is even more equivocal. For example, several studies have linked early post-natal stressors with the development of obesity, and elevated anxiety was associated with increased caloric intake in women. Conversely, presurgical stress and anxiety failed to alter food intake or dietary selection in men. Again, in a preclinical context, while a number of rodent studies indicate that restraint stress reduces food intake, neonatal maternal separation results in adolescent-onset hyperphagia; the reverse being observed when the offspring are exposed to an additional stressor.

Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), especially in the caudal dentate gyrus (DG), is a key cellular correlate of reduced anxiety. It is accelerated by CR and ghrelin exposure. Indeed, deletion of GHSR, the receptor for ghrelin, inhibits CR-induced augmentation of AHN and associated fear-memory performance. Mice with impaired AHN show a marked increase in anxiety-related behaviour, and although mice with augmented AHN show normal basal anxiety, glucocorticoid-induced anxiety is attenuated. Thus, AHN is uniquely positioned to connect feeding behaviour with anxiety via the activity of ghrelin.

Given this evidence for a role of AHN in feeding-induced modulation of anxiety, this study tests the obverse hypothesis, that altered AHN accompanies anxiety-induced changes in feeding. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying AHN, ghrelin secretion and indices of spontaneous feeding behaviour in rats selectively bred for high (HAB) and low (LAB) anxiety-like behaviour. HAB rats also display an initial reduction in hippocampal cell proliferation, with subsequent development of depressive-like, social and cognitive behaviours.
