Okay, now that we understand the anatomy of a paper, how do we actually read it in the most efficient way? What if I don't understand the technical jargon? 

Don't worry it is not insurmountable. Like I said before, reading a paper is a skill that can be learned and praciced.

Let's start with some strategies.

It may be helpful to adopt the "CREATES" method here, which helps you understand a paper and answer the most crucial questions

- WHY did they do the experiment?
- HOW did they do it?
- WHAT did they find?
- SO WHAT do these results mean?

Summary of reading:

Intro (skim, understand rationale and identify hypothesis) - WHY
Methods (skim, take note of general process and abbreviations, keep an eye out for red flags) - HOW
Results (take your time here - what were the actual results) - WHAT
Discussion 

Let's get started with a walkthrough of this paper:
