Every claim that is not common knowledge needs a citation.

You should provide a citation when you:

- Refer to previous research findings
- Present a theory, model, or definition developed by someone else
- Make a claim that could reasonably be questioned

You generally do not need a citation for widely accepted background facts (e.g., “DNA carries genetic information”), but it can help to cite a literature review for example that encompasses your broader topic.

A good rule of thumb: if the idea did not originate with you, or if it is not universally known within the field, cite it. Citations show where ideas come from and allow others to trace the evidence.
