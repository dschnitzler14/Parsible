By convention, scientific papers are written in an objective and impersonal style. This can give the impression that the findings presented are absolute truths, entirely absent of human intervention, and therefore absent of human error or fallibility.

This obviously is not true.

Remember, the authors of a paper are just humans too. A paper is simply a structured account of one attempt to answer a question. It does not mean the answer is correct, complete, or universally applicable. Even a perfectly executed study can only tell you what happened in that specific study, under those specific conditions, with that specific sample. In addition, good statistics matter, as they allow you to extrapolate the findings from one study to the larger population. It is up to you to assess the strength of the evidence presented in a paper, based on the methods, stats, and limitations, in order to judge how the findings contribute to the overall understanding of the field. 

Importantly, widely cited studies can still have limitations, hidden biases, questionable assumptions, or conclusions that stretch beyond the data. This is why reading and understanding papers yourself is a fundamental skill in research.
