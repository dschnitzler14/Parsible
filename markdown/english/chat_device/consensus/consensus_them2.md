4 out of 5 stars.

**Reasoning (brief):**

- **Clear, relevant question:** The study directly addresses whether intermittently reducing isolation mitigates its physical and hormonal effects in rats, an underexplored but important topic given human social isolation in aging and COVID-19 contexts (Uchida et al., 2024).
- **Solid experimental design:** Three groups (group‑housed, isolated, intervention with alternating housing) with standardized conditions and objectively measured outcomes (nanotag locomotion, ELISA hormones, muscle weights) support internal validity (Uchida et al., 2024).
- **Coherent results:** Isolation increased weight gain, food intake, corticosterone, myostatin, and reduced ghrelin, locomotor activity, and muscle/body‑weight ratios; the intervention group largely matched controls across outcomes (Uchida et al., 2024).
- **Transparency and limitations:** Authors acknowledge potential confounding from cage density and the preliminary nature of young‑rat data (Uchida et al., 2024).
- **Why not 5/5:** Small sample size, single sex/age, short duration, and only indirect relevance to human clinical interventions keep it from being a top‑tier, definitive study.
