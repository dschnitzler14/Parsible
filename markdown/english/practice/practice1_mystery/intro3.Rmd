MDD is a notably complex and common illness (1). It is often chronic or recurrent and is thus accompanied by considerable morbidity, disability, excess mortality, substantial costs, and heightened risk of suicide (2–8). Twin studies attribute approximately 40% of the variation in liability to MDD to additive genetic effects (phenotype heritability, h2) (9), and h2 may be greater for recurrent, early-onset, and postpartum MDD (10,11). `r actionLink(ns("practice_intro3_mystery1"), "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of MDD have had notable difficulties in identifying individual associated loci (12).", class = "invisible_yellow")` For example, there were no significant findings in the initial Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) MDD mega-analysis (9,240 cases) (13) or in the CHARGE meta-analysis of depressive symptoms (n = 34,549) (14). More recent studies have proven modestly successful. A study of Han Chinese women (5,303 recurrent MDD cases) identified significant loci (15), a meta-analysis of depressive symptoms (161,460 individuals) identified 2 loci (16), and an analysis of self-reported major depression identified 15 loci (75,607 cases). 

There are many reasons why identifying causal loci for MDD has proven difficult (12). MDD is probably influenced by many genetic loci, each with small effects (17), as are most common diseases (18), including psychiatric disorders (19,20). Estimates of the proportion of variance attributable to genome-wide SNPs (SNP heritability,hS2NP) indicate that around  one-quarter of the h2 for MDD is due to common genetic variants (21,22) and demonstrate that a genetic signal is detectable in genome-wide association data, implying that larger sample sizes are needed to detect specific loci given their effect sizes. Such a strategy has been proven in studies of schizophrenia, the flagship adult psychiatric disorder in genomics research. We thus accumulated clinical, population, and volunteer cohorts (23). This pragmatic approach takes the view that sample size can overcome heterogeneity to identify risk alleles that are robustly associated with major depression. Potential concerns about combining carefully curated research cohorts with volunteer cohorts were considered; multiple lines of evidence suggest that the results are likely to be applicable to clinical MDD. As discussed below, our analyses have neurobiological, clinical, and therapeutic relevance for major depression.
