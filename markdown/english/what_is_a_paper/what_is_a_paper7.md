# What is Open Science?

Open Science is a movement that is challenging the _status quo_, moving away from the "publish or perish" pressure, encouraging collaborative processes, and complete transparency. Open Science practices are built on the idea that science is a global public good, not a competition. Of course, researchers still want to stand out in their field, but that recognition can come from rigorous methods, careful analysis, reproducibility, and meaningful contribution rather than sheer publication count.

Open Science can include practices such as:

- Sharing data and code
- Pre-registering study designs and analysis plans
- Publishing pre-prints
- Open peer review
- Transparent reporting of methods and limitations

The core idea is to make research more accessible, more reproducible, and more accountable.

This does not mean science becomes easier. In many ways, it becomes more demanding. Transparency exposes weaknesses, forces clearer thinking, and invites scrutiny. But that scrutiny strengthens the work.

Open Science is not about removing standards, is about raising them, while making the process fairer and more inclusive.
