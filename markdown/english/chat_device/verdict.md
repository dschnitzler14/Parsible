# The Verdict

As you’ve just seen, the AI tools make this paper sound very trustworthy and rigorous, but your human reasoning can tell that it’s not.

AI systems are very good at summarising and rephrasing what a paper claims. They are much worse at noticing what’s missing, what’s weakly justified, or what simply doesn’t add up.

<strong>🤖 What AI is actually doing</strong>
<div style="margin-top: 10px; line-height: 1.45;">
AI responds primarily to what is <em>written on the page</em>.  
It does not independently evaluate whether the methods are appropriate, whether assumptions are justified, or whether the conclusions truly follow.

## What AI misses

<div style="
  background-color: #f8f9fa;
  border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.08);
  padding: 14px 16px;
  margin: 16px 0;

">
<ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 18px;">
  <li><strong>Gaps in methods or logic</strong>, missing controls, unclear procedures, or unjustified assumptions.</li>
  <li><strong>Inappropriate analysis</strong>, such as flawed stats.</li>
  <li><strong>Misleading framing</strong>, it often repeats the authors’ narrative, even when that framing is questionable.</li>
  <li><strong>Overconfident conclusions</strong>, unless explicitly prompted, it rarely challenges what the paper claims.</li>
</ul>

🧠 <strong>Use your own brain:</strong>  
AI is a tool, not a shortcut. Your job as a scholar is to think critically and independently, not to outsource judgement.

## Why this matters

Carrying forward bad science is like making a small mistake in maths.

<div style="
  border-left: 4px solid #dc3545;
  background-color: #fdeeee;
  padding: 12px 14px;
  margin: 16px 0;
  border-radius: 6px;
  line-height: 1.45;

A small error early on gets carried forward.  
Later steps may look polished and convincing, but the final conclusion is still wrong.
</div>

<strong>Bottom line:</strong> trust your critical thinking.  
It’s more impressive (and far more reliable) than what AI can do.
