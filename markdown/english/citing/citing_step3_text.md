Citations appear in two places: in the text and in the reference list (aka bibliography).

In-text citations are short. They point to the source of a claim, which the reader can then look up in the bibliography. Depending on the citation style, this might be an author and year (e.g., Smith, 2020) or a number (e.g., [3]).

The reference list appears at the end of the paper. This is where you provide the full details of every source cited, with enough information for the reader to locate the original work.

> Remember, in science, you only include in your reference list the sources you have actually cited in the text. You do not need to cite (or list) everything you read while researching or understanding a topic.
