Rather than reading every word from top to bottom, it helps to take a methodical approach. This keeps you focused on the most important questions a paper is trying to answer:

- Introduction: - the **WHY** : skim to understand the rationale and identify the hypothesis
- Methods - the **HOW**: skim to grasp the general approach, note key abbreviations, and watch for red flags 
- Results - the **WHAT**:  this is where the data are presented - read this more carefully, this is the core of the paper
- Discussion - the **SO WHAT**: read critically to see how the authors interpret their findings
