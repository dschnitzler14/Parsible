The methods section can feel overwhelming at first. This section describes what experiments were carried out and how, in such a way that they should be easily replicable by anyone.

However, you will sometimes find phrases such as "as previously described" and a citation, meaning the authors have already described this exact method in a previous paper.

⚠️ <strong>Warning:</strong> This may lead you down a rabbit-hole, chasing a methods section through several decades of past papers. On one hand this can indicate that this is a very robust method, but on the other hand if a method hasn't changed in 30 years, that can indicate that the findings are in fact not so robust and don't hold up with alternative or newer methods.

In the methods section there a few things to look out for and take note of. There is no expectation that you know and understand every single scientific method in existance, but over time, you will come to recognise techniques that are relevant to your field.

It is particularly important here to make a note of different abbreviations used throughout (or you'll be scrolling back from a figure wondering what CHL and CHD stand for!) and what was done for the different experiments (i.e. experiment 1 and experiment 2).

Even if you are not 100% confident with a particular method, you can apply common sense here. For example, if the study is examining the effects of stress on food intake, you might want to check that the animals are being fed food they actually eat or similar sanity checks.

<strong>🚩 Red flags in the Methods section</strong>

<ul style="margin: 10px 0 0 18px; line-height: 1.45;">
  <li>No justification for sample sizes (e.g. <code>n = 10</code> with no explanation)</li>
  <li>Sample sizes are unnecessarily small</li>
  <li>Statistical analyses are oversimplified or unclear</li>
  <li>Statistical anylyses do not describe initial checks like normality</li>
  <li>Inclusion or exclusion criteria do not make sense</li>
  <li>No mention of blinding or randomisation when expected</li>
  <li>Multiple comparisons without correction</li>
  <li>Data or code are unavailable without appropriate justification (statements like "available on reasonable request" are a red flag)</li>
</ul>
