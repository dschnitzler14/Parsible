It may feel overwhelming to read scientific papers full of jargon! That is completely normal. Scientific writing is challenging even for native speakers, and can be a little tricker if English isn't your first language!

Here are a few things that might help to remember:

- You do not need to understand every word to understand the paper - try to focus on main ideas, results, and conclusions
- Look up key terms, but avoid translating whole paragraphs. Try to understand meaning from context.
- The more you read, the more familiar you will become with jargon
- If possible, discuss the paper with peers. Explaining ideas helps strengthen understanding.

> Reading academic jargon is a skill that improves with practice.
