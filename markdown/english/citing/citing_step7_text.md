- Citing something you haven’t read.
  Don’t cite a paper just because you saw it referenced somewhere else. Always read the original source before citing it (and not just the abstract!)

- Mismatched in-text citations and reference list entries.
  Every in-text citation must appear in the reference list, and every reference list entry must be cited in the text.

- Incorrect author order or spelling.
  Author order matters in science. Make sure names are spelled correctly and listed in the correct sequence.

- Inconsistent formatting.
  Pick one style and stick to it!

- Citing secondary sources instead of primary research.
  Whenever possible, cite the original study rather than a review, blog post, or news article describing it.

- Outdated or broken links.
  Use DOIs or stable URLs wherever possible to ensure long-term access.
