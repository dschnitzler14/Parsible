By convention, scientific papers are written in an objective and impersonal style. This can give the impression that the findings presented are absolute truths, entirely absent of human intervention, and therefore absent of human error or fallibility.

This obviously is not true.

Remember, the authors of a paper are just humans too. A paper is simply a structured account of one attempt to answer a question. It does not mean the answer is correct, complete, or universally applicable. Even a perfectly executed study can only tell you what happened in that specific study, under those specific conditions, with that specific sample.

This is where good statistics matter. It is impossible to sample an entire population, so researchers aim to collect a sample that reasonably represents it. But whether the results are trustworthy depends on the methods, the design, the measurements, and the analysis. And even if the data are solid, you might disagree with how the authors interpret or extrapolate their findings.

Importantly, citation count does not equal correctness. Widely cited studies can still have limitations, hidden biases, questionable assumptions, or conclusions that stretch beyond the data.

So reading a paper is not about passively absorbing “facts.” It is about evaluating evidence.

It is up to you to decide how much weight to give a study and its findings.

But how do you judge whether a paper is worth believing? What questions should you be asking? And once you’ve made that judgement, what do you do with it?
