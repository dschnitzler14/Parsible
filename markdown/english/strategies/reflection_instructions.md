In this final step, take a moment to reflect on this paper - what were the strengths, what were the weaknesses? Do you think this study was rigorous? Using the rating system you have been using throughout, a star rating is calculated, rating this paper from 1-5 stars, just like a book on Goodreads. I would encourage you to write a little review of your own - you can see mine below.

If your rating or review doesn't match mine, that is totally okay! This is entirely objective and your opinion matters here! Maybe you even picked up on things that I missed, or maybe you disagree with me about the importance of a particular aspect. All absolutely valid!
