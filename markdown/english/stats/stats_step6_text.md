    Main Concept
  </div>
    The <span class="ps-highlight-term">sample size</span> has a big effect on the statistical results, but it is important to strike the right balance between "big enough" and "too big".

<p class="ps-lede"> When interpreting results in a paper it is important to look at the sample size. It is very common for studies to use an <span class="ps-highlight-wrong">arbitrary number of samples</span>, for example, n = 10, simply because that is what has been done before, or because it “worked” in a previous paper.</p>

<div class="ps-block ps-def">
  <div class="ps-term">What sample size should be based on</div>
  <div>
  Using an arbitrary number can lead to underpowered studies that miss real effects, or overpowered studies that detect trivial differences that are not actually meaningful.

## Power Analysis

<p class="ps-lede">Luckily, there is a way to calculate how many samples needed to adequately test a hypothesis at a given effect size. This is called a <span class="ps-highlight-term">power analysis</span>.</p>

<div class="ps-block ps-def">
  <div class="ps-term">Power analysis</div>
  <div>
    A power analysis is made up of four components - if you know, or can estimate three, then you can calculate the fourth.

## Sample Selection

<p class="ps-lede">Statistical inference assumes that your sample is drawn from a defined population using an appropriate sampling process. If the sample is <span class="ps-highlight-term">biased</span> or not randomly selected, the probabilities calculated by statistical tests may no longer accurately reflect the true error rates.</p>

<div class="ps-divider"></div>

## Convenience Sample

<p class="ps-lede">Sometimes you will see the term <span class="ps-quote-inline">convenience sample</span>, which means participants were selected because they were easy to acceses, such as students from the researcher’s own university or animals already available in a laboratory.</p>
