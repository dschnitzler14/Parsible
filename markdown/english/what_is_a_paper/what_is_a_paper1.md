# Okay so what even is a paper?

A "paper" is a broad umbrella term that encompasses any scholarly communication. While different fields might have specific types, in science there are a number of different types of papers, for example

**1. Literature Reviews**
   
These are often broad summaries of the existing literature, gathering all the current knowledge around a specific topic or question. Sometimes these can be retrospectives, which recount the history of the evidence that we have gathered to date, other times they are snapshots of what the authors consider to be the most important evidence required to understand a topic or question.

**2. Systematic Review**

This type sits in-between literature reviews and scientific studies. These systematically analyse all the evidence on a study to try and synthesise overarching evidence. These use papers that have already been published and do specific statistical analyses to determine the strength of difference pieces of evidence.

**3. Meta-analyses**
   
These use existing datasets that are analysed differently. Important to note, meta-analyses are different from systemic reviews.

**4. Original research papers**

Present new data collected and analysed by the authors. These are often what people mean when they say “a paper” in science.

**5. Case studies**
   
Detailed reports of a single case (or small number of cases), often used in clinical or applied fields.

**6. Methods papers**

Describe a new technique, protocol, or analytical approach.

## What is the difference between a paper and a book?

In science especially, papers are the primary way new knowledge enters the academic conversation. Books usually come later, after enough research has accumulated synthesise it.

Another way to think about it: A paper is a single brick, while a book is a wall built from many bricks.

Both matter in constructing an understanding of a subject, but when you are reading scientific literature, you are usually reading individual bricks. Your job is to examine how solid each one is before deciding whether it helps hold up the wall.

Another key difference is speed. Papers are generally much faster to publish than books. Once a study is completed, a paper can move through peer review and appear in a journal within months (though this can vary). Books, however, usually take much longer, often years, because they require extended writing, editing, proposal review, and a more complex publishing process. This means papers are typically how new findings enter the academic conversation quickly, while books tend to reflect more established bodies of knowledge.
