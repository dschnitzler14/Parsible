Okay, let’s pause here for a moment.

You’ve read the Introduction, Methods, and Results. Before we move on, let’s make sure we’re clear on what the paper has actually shown, and what it has not shown.

<strong>Before you read the Discussion</strong><br>
  <p>
    The Discussion is where the authors explain what they think the results mean and how the findings fit into a wider context.
    Before you read it, make a prediction. This helps you spot strong reasoning and also notice when the interpretation goes beyond the data.
