There is no such thing as a perfect model, a perfect experiment, or a perfect paper.

## What is a model?

A scientific model, for example, of a disease, is a simplified representation of a complex biological reality.

It might be an animal model, a cell culture system, a computational simulation, or even a statistical model. Each of these captures certain features of the disease while inevitably leaving others out. A mouse model of a neurological disorder, for instance, may replicate specific genetic or behavioural aspects, but it cannot fully reproduce the human experience of the condition. A cell model may allow tight experimental control, but it removes the broader physiological context of a whole organism.

Models are useful because they make complex systems testable. They allow researchers to isolate variables, manipulate conditions, and explore mechanisms in ways that would be impossible, or unethical, in humans. But they are approximations, not replicas.

The key question is not “Is this model perfect?” but “Is this model appropriate for the question being asked?” A good model is one that captures the aspects of reality that matter for the specific hypothesis under investigation, while acknowledging what it cannot represent.

## There are ways to reduce limitations, and that’s what we aim to do

No model is ever a flawless representation of reality. Every experiment simplifies something. Every study operates within constraints: time, funding, access to sample size, available tools, ethics, and human judgement.

Science does not aim for perfection. Instead, the goal is not to eliminate limitations (which is impossible), but to identify them, minimise them where possible, and be transparent about them. Strong research acknowledges its weaknesses, justifies its choices, and avoids overclaiming.

This is also why thoughtful statistics are important in our toolbox of science. Used well, stats help us estimate uncertainty, test hypotheses, and avoid being misled by random variation. However, used poorly, they can make weak evidence look convincing.

Importantly, “statistically significant” does not automatically mean “important” or “meaningful.” A tiny effect can be statistically significant in a large sample, while an important effect might not reach significance in a small one. This is why interpretation matters just as much as calculation.

## Learning to accept nuance

For example, a study can be well designed and still limited. It can provide useful evidence without being definitive. It can move the field forward even if it does not settle the question.

If you expect perfection, you will either accept everything uncritically (“It’s published, so it must be right”) or reject everything (“There’s a flaw, so it’s useless”). Neither reflects how science actually works.

Reading scientifically means weighing evidence, not searching for perfection.
