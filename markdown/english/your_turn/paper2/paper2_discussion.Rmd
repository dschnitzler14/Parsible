The beneficial effects of exercise are well established [96] and rat models provide an efficient means of facilitating behavioural, neurochemical, and histological investigations of the effects of exercise on feeding and body weight. However, there are anomalies associated with rat models, and the literature on the effects of exercise on feeding in the rat can be confusing. For example, basic factors such as the type of exercise and the sex of the rat can affect the outcome of a study [97]. In fact, different results can be obtained while using the same exercise apparatus. Foright et al. [10] found that four weeks of treadmill exercise reduced weight gain in male rats while sustaining weight gain in female rats. In Experiment 1 of the current study, forced treadmill exercise decreased cumulative food intake in male rats at all three exercise intensities investigated. It is well established that treadmill exercise results in a decrease in food intake in male rats [e.g., 98,99], and that different intensities of forced exercise have progressive effects on food intake reduction in male rats [13]. In the current study, forced treadmill exercise significantly decreased food intake relative to no exercise at 1, 2 and 3 h post-exercise, and all three of the exercise intensities investigated significantly reduced food intake at all three timepoints. As the maximum numerical effect of forced treadmill exercise on food intake reduction was observed at 54 m/min in Experiment 1, this level of forced exercise intensity was employed in Experiment 2. Experiment 2 investigated the effect of forced treadmill exercise in the male rat on c-Fos activation in specific brain sites. Compared to the no exercise condition, there were significant increases in c-Fos expression in the CeA, CPu, dBNST, PVN, VMH, DMH and LH, which are brain sites associated with feeding behaviour. There was no significant increase in c-Fos expression in the forced treadmill exercise condition compared to the no exercise condition in the FC, a brain site which is not associated with feeding behaviour. 

The outcome of the current study supports the observation that c-Fos expression in the CeA increased relative to the intensity of treadmill exercise in male rats [22]. Recently, there has been increased interest in the role of the CeA in feeding behaviour in general, and in the regulation of feeding behaviour in particular [17], and Timofeeva et al. [37] found c-Fos activation in the CPu of male rats immediately after treadmill running, which is similar to the result of the current study. There is evidence that the CPu plays a role in feeding regulation. For example, when dopamine production in the CPu as restored in hypophagic dopamine-deficient mice, more than 90 % of the mice consume sufficient food to regain body weight, and some mice even gain body weight [100]. With respect to the dBNST, there are no published journal articles on the effects of exercise on c-Fos activation, even though this area projects to two brain regions known to be involved in appetitive behaviours, the VTA [47] and the LH [48,49]. The current study is the first to report that forced treadmill exercise in the male rat results in c-Fos expression in the dBNST. 

The role of the hypothalamus in feeding behaviours has been extensively studied, as have the roles of its various subdivisions. The PVN is an important site for energy homeostasis [e.g., 101]. The current study found that forced treadmill exercise in the male rat resulted in c-Fos activation in the PVN. This is in keeping with the finding of Lima et al. [68], who reported that motor driven treadmill exercise in male rats increased c-Fos expression in the PVN. Nunez et al. [102] had previously reported increased c-Fos expression in the PVN of male rats 1 h following forced exercise in a motor-driven running wheel. More recently, Ezure et al. [22] found increased c-Fos expression in the PVN of male rats that was related to the intensity of forced treadmill running. The VMH is involved in several behavioural functions, including glucose regulation and appetitive behaviour [69]. Angeles-Castellanos et al. [78] found that when they trained male rats under food deprivation or fasting-feeding conditions, the restricted feeding group did not demonstrate an increase in c-Fos activity in the VMH. However, elevated Fos expression has been observed in the VMH of male rats after cerebral or systemic hyperglycaemia. Dunn-Meynell et al. [79] infused glucose into the right internal carotid artery and found Fos-like expression in the VMH, and Carrasco et al. [80] found Fos-like expression in the VMH following intraperitoneal injections of a bolus of insulin and glucose. The current study found that forced treadmill exercise resulted in c-Fos activation in the VMH, and as with the dBNST, the current study is the first to report the relationship between forced treadmill exercise and c-Fos activation in the VMH.

The DMH is involved in feeding, energy expenditure, and body weight regulation [83]. Angeles-Castellanos et al. [78] found that restricted feeding schedules increased c-Fos expression in the DMH of male rats, Zhang et al. [87] reported that voluntary wheel running increased c-Fos cell numbers in male rats, and Barna et al. [86] found c-Fos expression in the DMH of male rats following forced treadmill exercise. The current study also found that forced treadmill exercise in the male rat resulted in c-Fos activation in the DMH, thus confirming the observation of Barna et al. [86]. The LH is known to be involved in feeding and reward [49]. Angeles-Castellanos et al. [78] reported increased c-Fos expression in the LH when male rats were subjected to restricted feeding schedules, Barna et al. [86] found that intense forced treadmill exercise resulted in c-Fos activation in the LH of male rats, and Barna et al. [103] reported that acute episodes of forced treadmill exercise in the male rat significantly increased c-Fos activation in the LH. The current study also found that forced treadmill exercise in the male rat resulted in c-Fos activation in the LH, confirming the observation of one Barna et al. study [86] and supporting the observation of the second Barna et al. study [103]. A brain site that has not been traditionally associated with the neurobiology of exercise and consummatory behaviours is the FC. This brain site was also sectioned and analysed to add an extra control element and rule out false positives. There was no elevation of c-Fos expression in the FC.

A recent study by Many et al. [104], proposed an explanation for the anomalous effect of exercise in male and female rats. It suggested that the different effects of exercise may be due to sex-specific metabolic elements, male rats running on a treadmill burn off fat and keep it off, whereas female rats initially burn fat but regain it over a period of eight weeks. The current study addresses some of the questions relating to the use of rat models of the effects of exercise on behaviour and relating to c-Fos activation in brain sites implicated in feeding. It confirms the findings of previous studies showing that forced treadmill exercise results in decreased food intake in the male rat and also that forced treadmill exercise in the male rat produces increased c-Fos expression in the CeA, CPu, PVN, DMH and LH. In addition, the current study is the first to report that forced treadmill exercise in the male rat results in increased c-Fos expression in the dBNST and the VMH.
