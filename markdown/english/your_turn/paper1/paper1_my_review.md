- Overall, this is a very poor study.

- The introduction doesn't clearly define what the aims or hypotheses are, nor what exact gap in the knowledge the study is addressing.

- The methods do not clarify how they arrived at sample size. Also, the limited age of only males certainly limits the interpretation of the results

- The analysis is concerning - it is not clear what statistical analysis was performed to obtain the p-values, whether they corrected for repeated sampling (before/ after).

- The results are very unclear, in addition to likely being false - the results for the control group are identical before and after placebo

- The discussion does not capture the actual results well or place them in the context of other results regarding the effects of caffeine on HR and BP. The authors also make speculative claims that cannot be substantiated.

- The authors also describe arterial stiffness, which is distinct from BP, and was not measured in this study

- Finally, their conclusion describes an increase in HR, which is not described in their results.
