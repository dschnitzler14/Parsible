Managing citations manually becomes difficult very quickly, especially as the number of sources grows. A reference manager helps you organise, store, format, and insert citations automatically.

- Import papers directly from databases
- Store PDFs and annotate them
- Organise and categorise your reading
- Insert in-text citations while writing
- Automatically generate and switch between citation styles
- Keep your reference list consistent and correctly formatted
