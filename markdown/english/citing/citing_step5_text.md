Whenever possible, use a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) rather than a generic URL.

A DOI is a permanent, unique identifier assigned to a publication. Even if a journal’s website changes, the DOI link should always redirect to the correct location. This makes it far more reliable than copying and pasting a long, unstable web address.

For websites, consider credibility. Ask yourself

- Who authored the page?
- Is it an official organisation, a government body, a recognised institution?
- Does it list a publication date and author?

> Websites can change, disappear, or be updated without notice, so make sure the source is stable and trustworthy before citing it.

> Try to cite an original, peer-reviewed source whenever possible
