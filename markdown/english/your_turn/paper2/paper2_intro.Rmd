The cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathway is a second messenger, and because its regulation at the intracellular level is critical for the transduction of cellular response, the role of cAMP generation in bipolar disorder and especially major depressive disorder (MDD) has been studied extensively [see review, (1)]. Most of these studies, using different materials, specimens, and methods, reported a downregulation in the production of cAMP in patients with MDD versus normal controls and patients in a euthymic or a manic state (1).

Mean levels of cAMP in the plasma of patients with bipolar disorder were not different between the different phases of their illness or compared to controls (2). Beta adrenoreceptor–mediated cAMP formation, using histamine, prostaglandin E1, or isoproterenol, was not different in the lymphoblasts of depressed patients versus controls (3), and no difference was found either in the affinity or the density of beta receptors on lymphoblasts between patients with bipolar disorder and controls (3, 4). Studies of histamine-stimulated and beta adrenoreceptor–mediated cAMP formation in leukocytes from patients with MDD and controls reported lower cAMP levels (i.e., downregulation) in patients with MDD versus controls (5–7). When cAMP formation was measured in isoproterenol-stimulated lymphocytes and not in leukocytes, lower cAMP levels were found only in patients with MDD and psychomotor agitation, not in patients with psychomotor retardation (8, 9). Reduction in beta-adrenoreceptor–linked cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) was reported in patients with MDD and melancholic features versus controls (10), suggesting low levels of cAMP.

The heterogeneity of the subjects and the differences in disease severity, in the specimens in which cAMP was measured (plasma, stimulated leukocytes/lymphocytes, and platelets), and in the methods used for determination of cAMP levels may have contributed to the different, and in certain studies, opposite, findings (1).

The theory of cAMP dysfunction as a cause of MDD and of depression in general was proposed (11) on the basis of findings of cAMP-signaling downregulation in MDD and its upregulation with chronic administration of antidepressants in one postmortem study in humans (12) and in studies in rodents (13). This theory was further supported by findings of decreased cAMP signaling in the brains of unmedicated depressed patients and increased cAMP signaling after treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor using ¹¹C-(R)-rolipram PET scan to image phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) (14). Neither of these studies nor any cAMP studies investigated whether the reported changes are state-dependent or not.

The mitochondrial dysfunction theory of MDD was proposed to explain the downregulation of cAMP and the hypometabolism observed during MDD (15, 16). However, recent studies have linked suppression of mitochondrial function, including low adenosine triphosphate (ATP) turnover, but not mitochondrial dysfunction, to MDD and have suggested the need for further investigation of mitochondrial changes during MDD (17–20).

A theory explaining the origin of the hypometabolism observed during MDD was proposed by the first author in 2005 (21), arguing that a form of metabolic depression, a primitive adaptive process for energy preservation that is homologous to the one responsible for mammalian hibernation—and not mitochondrial dysfunction—is the process underlying the observed hypometabolism, state-dependent neurobiological changes (22, 23), and vegetative symptoms of MDD in humans. Supporting evidence for this metabolic depression theory of MDD and for its link to the process of mammalian hibernation (21) is the finding that suppression of mitochondrial metabolism is the process responsible for mammalian hibernation (24, 25), including low ATP turnover (26, 27), as well as the similarities to the findings from mitochondrial studies in MDD (17–20).

The following state-dependent neurobiological changes that have been documented as being similar between MDD in humans and mammalian hibernation offer further support for the metabolic depression theory of MDD (21): reversible subclinical hypothyroidism (28, 29), increased serum cortisol concentration (30–32), acute phase protein response (33–38), low respiratory quotient (39–42), oxidative stress response (43–45), and decreased neurotransmitter levels (39, 46, 47). Black bears (Ursus americanus) were suggested and used as an animal model for MDD to study the process of hypometabolism during hibernation (21) because many of the similar neurobiological changes between MDD and mammalian hibernation had been observed in studies of bears, especially black bears, during hibernation (29, 32, 36, 37, 40, 45). The full rationale for using this model has been explained previously [(21); see pp. 830–831]. Black bears in the wild withdraw into dens in October, and by November 1st, most are in the state of hibernation proper without becoming hypothermic (32, 40, 41). Hypothermia, which is common in all other hibernating mammals, suppresses gene expression and the translation and transcriptional machinery of many proteins (48).

Mammalian hibernation is a state of metabolic stress, which leads to the dephosphorylation of ATP through the activation of adenylyl cyclase and the formation of cAMP, which is converted to adenosine 5′ nucleotidase (5′ AMP) (1, 49). According to these findings (49), higher cAMP concentration would be expected in the lysed leukocytes of black bears before entrance into hibernation, the basic state of hypometabolism, when the process shifts from normal to the state of metabolic depression, and low cAMP levels are expected during hibernation proper. To compare our expected findings of cAMP level changes during mammalian hibernation with the reported findings during MDD in humans, to investigate the state-dependent status of cAMP levels, and to obtain additional supporting evidence for the metabolic depression theory of MDD (21), we measured the baseline changes of cAMP levels in serial blood samples obtained every 15 days during active, pre-hibernation, and hibernation states from nine female captive black bears kept in captivity from October to May 15. Serum cortisol levels also were measured from the serial samples obtained from these same bears plus one additional bear. We report our findings here.
