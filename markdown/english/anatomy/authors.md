On the simplest level, the authors are the people who contributed to paper. There are very clear and strict rules that define who can be an author on a paper and you must demonstrate meaningful contribution. On some papers you can find the exact breakdown of who did what in a section called <a href="https://credit.niso.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CRediT</a> or simply "Author Contribution". In cases where someone has contributed, but not enough to be an author they will be thanked in the acknowledgement section.

The order of the authors has meaning too - the first author is generally the person who led the study while the last author is generally the head of the lab, senior researcher, or principle investigator (PI). It is not uncommon to have joint first-authors. Remember when a paper is cited, the first author is the name that will appear, while everyone else is "_et al_". e.g. "Smith _et al._"

Finally, the author section also includes various affiliations, i.e. what institute or university they belong to and who the corresponding author is - the main point of contact for a paper.

⚠️ <strong>Warning:</strong> Some papers have 100s of authors due to global collaborations or long-term or multi-disciplinary projects. This is not necessarily a bad thing, just something to be aware of.
