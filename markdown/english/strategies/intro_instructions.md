The introduction of a paper _introduces_ you to the topic - it should explain what the overarching need was for the study (for example, here: negative effects social isolation affecting many older people), what evidence is already known, and crucially, what is _not known_, leading to the need for this particular study.

Assuming we are reading this paper as novices, we want to highlight the background information we do not yet know - this can help us in our wider understanding by highlighting what studies have already been carried out and how this particular study seeks to address a gap in the knowlegde.
