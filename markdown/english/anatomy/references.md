The reference section is fairly straightforward: this is where you can find all the papers that have been cited in the work. It is an excellent place to go if you are new to a field and want to read more studies around a topic, see which papers are considered foundational, and identify key authors or journals.

⚠️ <strong>Warning:</strong>
If you find yourself looking up papers that don’t seem to exist, this is a strong indication that the work may
be AI-generated. Generative AI systems are known to hallucinate references, including article titles, DOIs,
or journal names.

<strong>📝 What is a DOI?</strong>
A DOI (Digital Object Identifier) is a permanent, unique identifier assigned to a scholarly work. It allows
you to reliably locate a paper online, even if the journal’s website or URL changes.

<strong>📝 What are all these numbers next to the journal name?</strong>
These usually refer to the <strong>volume</strong>, <strong>issue number</strong>, and <strong>page range</strong> (or article number). Together, they tell you exactly where the paper appears within a journal.
