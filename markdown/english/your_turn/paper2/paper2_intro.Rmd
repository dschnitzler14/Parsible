Considerable evidence indicates the benefits of exercise [1], and in addition to its benefits generally, it has been found to improve elements of behaviour determined through central processes such as memory [2], anxiety [3] and depression [4]. An obvious effect of exercise is on body weight [5], and aspects of body weight and food intake are known to be governed by central processes [e.g., 6–8]. Manipulations to investigate central determinants of food intake and body weight usually involve the use of experimental animals, and the experimental animal of choice is often the rat. However, even though rat models have even been used to investigate the effects of exercise on various diseases in rats [9], there are issues with using rats to examine the effects of exercise. For example, it has been found that four weeks of forced exercise reduces weight gain and decreases food intake in male rats but sustains weight gain and increases food intake in female rats [10]. The effects of sex differences on exercise-induced changes in rat neurophysiology have been investigated specifically [11]. Forced or voluntary exercise in the rat have also been explored [e.g., 12], as have the consequences of the intensity and duration of exercise [e.g., 13]. Even the type of apparatus used, treadmill or running wheel, affects the experimental outcome, and this is true for both rats [14] and mice [15,16]. The current study used forced exercise to investigate the effect of treadmill exercise intensity on food intake in the male rat, and using c-Fos immunoreactivity, on activation of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), caudate putamen (CPu), dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dBNST), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), and lateral hypothalamus (LH), all of which are brain sites known to be involved in feeding. To control for false positives, a brain area not implicated in feeding, the frontal cortex (FC), was also included in the analysis for increased c-Fos expression. The CeA is involved in energy balance and feeding behaviour [17]. Lesions of the CeA increase food intake and result in increased body weight [18], hence the CeA is implicated in anorexic effects. In fasted rats [19] and mice [20], refeeding results in c-Fos activation in the CeA. Kim et al. [21], investigating cardiovascular responses during high-intensity treadmill exercise in the male rat, found that c-Fos activation in the amygdala increased in an exercise intensity dependent manner, and Ezure et al. [22] found that forced treadmill exercise in male rats increased c-Fos expression in the CeA in an exercise intensity dependent manner. The dorsal area of the striatum is called the CPu and it is an important component of the reward signalling pathways [23]. In humans it seems to be sensitive to the availability of food rather than to the calorific content [24], and there is evidence from non-human and human animal studies indicating that it is involved in encoding the effort requirements for a reward [25–28]. The CPu is associated with the nutritional but not the hedonic importance of sugar intake in mice [29]. It has been proposed to play a part in the regulation of food consumption and palatability [30,31], and in the pathology of eating disorders, including obesity and anorexia nervosa [32–34]. Voluntary wheel running exercise in mice reduces adenosine and increases dopamine D2 receptor protein expression in the CPu and ventral striatum, possibly enhancing behavioural processes [35], but no difference in c-Fos expression has been found in the CPu of mice showing perseverative behaviour on an operant task [36]. However, Timofeeva et al. [37] found c-Fos activation in the CPu of male rats immediately after 60 mins of treadmill running. In humans, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) has been found to modulate PVN function, and the dBNST is predominantly preautomatic [38]. In non-human animals, the BNST is known to be involved in sustained fear [39], aggressive behaviours [40,41], social attachment and initiation of mating [42], and in parental bonding [43]. It has projections to the hypothalamus which allow feeding to be monitored, has brainstem projections associated with the maintenance of drinking, and it appears to be involved in energy balance [44]. Activation of BNST neurons projecting to the LH induces feeding [45], and it has been proposed that there might be a microcircuit linked to the regulation of food intake [46]. The dBNST projects to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) [47] and to the LH [48,49], which are regions associated with appetitive behaviours. Dopamine release is increased in the dBNST during intra-oral sucrose infusion [50], and when cues are presented that predict intracranial self-stimulation [51,52]. Also, when a dopamine D1 receptor antagonist is injected in the dBNST, operant responding for sucrose is reduced [53]. There have been some studies on the BNST employing the use of c-Fos [e.g., 54] but these were not related to food intake, and there are no published studies that address the effects of exercise on c-Fos expression in the dBNST. The function of the hypothalamus in consummatory behaviour has been studied since the 1840s [55]. Seminal findings were reported when Hetherington & Ranson [56] demonstrated that destruction of the VMH increased food intake and produced obesity in the rat, and the work of Anand & Brobeck [57,58] contributed to demonstrating the role of the hypothalamus in the control of food intake in the rat. The hypothalamus is important for the regulation of blood glucose levels and body weight [59–61]. The PVN is implicated in the regulation of feeding behaviour [62], lesions of the PVN result in increased body weight in male and female rats [63], and neurons projecting from the PVN regulate energy balance [64,65]. Intracerebroventricular administration of neuropeptide-Y (NPY) produces increased food consumption [66] and induces of c-Fos expression in the PVN of the rat [67]. Lima et al. [68], using a treadmill to investigate thermoregulatory responses in male rats found that c-Fos expression in the PVN gradually increased during exercise. The VMH is anatomically preserved across mammalian species, and since the 1940s hundreds of studies have been published on its role in feeding (see [69] for review). The VMH is of importance in energy expenditure regulation [70] and in adaptive energy expenditure [71]. There is evidence that the VMH plays a part in energy metabolism during exercise [72–77]. There is an increase in noradrenergic activity in the VMH which is related to enhanced oxidation of fat during exercise [77], but while increased c-Fos has been observed in almost all hypothalamic nuclei investigated in rats exposed to restricted feeding schedules, the exceptions are the VMH and the suprachiasmatic nucleus [78]. However, increased Fos expression has been found in the VMH of male rats after cerebral [79] or systemic hyperglycaemia [80].

Preliminary research subdivided the hypothalamus into feeding and satiety centres located in the VMH and the LH, as electrical stimulation or ablation produced opposing changes in feeding behaviour [57,58,81, 82]. Because lesions of the DMH reduce food intake, the DMH was thought to be an appetite-stimulating centre [83]. Electrical stimulation produced hyperphagia [84,85] and various subsequent lesioning studies confirmed the role of the DMH relative to feeding, drinking, and body weight regulation [83]. Treadmill running exercise in the male rat was found to result in c-Fos expression in the DMH [86], and voluntary wheel running increased c-Fos cell numbers in the DMH of male Sprague-Dawley rats but not male obese Zucker rats [87]. Restricted feeding schedules also increased c-Fos expression in the DMH of male rats [78]. In early experiments the LH was identified as an important area for motivated behaviour. Electrical stimulation of the LH induces hyperphagia, and in the absence of food experimental animals lever press robustly for electrical stimulation [88], thus suggesting an interaction between reward and food intake [49,89]. Following the discovery of neurons in the arcuate nucleus that invoke opposing effects on feeding [90,91], the concept of specific feeding and satiety centres has been superseded. However, the LH is still of interest to researchers investigating eating disorders and reward related function and disfunction [92], and work is progressing on mapping feeding and self-stimulation sites in the LH of the rat [93]. In rats exposed to restricted feeding schedules there is increased c-Fos expression in the LH [78], and intense forced treadmill exercise produces c-Fos expression in the LH of male rats [86]. The FC [94] is not associated with consummatory behaviour in the rat and was included to control for false positives in the data reflecting c-Fos activity following forced exercise. The purpose of the current study was to determine the effect of forced treadmill exercise in the male rat on food intake at three exercise intensities. Then to use the forced exercise intensity with the maximum effect on food intake to investigate c-Fos expression in the CeA, CPu, dBNST, PVN VMH, DMH and LH, brain sites known to be involved in feeding behaviour.
