There are many citation styles (e.g., APA, Vancouver, Harvard), and each has its own formatting rules for in-text citations and reference lists.

Switching between formats or inconsistently listing information makes your work look careless and can make sources harder to locate.

If you are writing for a journal, follow the journal’s guidelines. If you are submitting coursework, follow the required style. And if no style is specified, choose a recognised one and apply it carefully from start to finish.
