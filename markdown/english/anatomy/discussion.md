The discussion section takes the findings described in the Results section and places them in the broader context of the field. This is where the authors explain what their results mean, how they relate to existing knowledge, and why they matter.

A good discussion balances interpretation with caution. It should acknowledge uncertainty, consider alternative explanations, and avoid overstating what the study can and cannot conclude.
