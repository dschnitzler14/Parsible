In the context of emerging evidence that elevations in ghrelin secretion induced by feeding patterns and CR promote AHN and reduce anxiety, we tested the obverse hypothesis, that elevated innate anxiety-related behaviour disrupts temporal feeding patterns and is accompanied by reduced AHN. While the data we present from the HAB–LAB rat model do not support this hypothesis, elevated anxiety has a clear impact on the feeding–ghrelin–neurogenesis pathway. The hyper-anxious HAB rats displayed mild hypophagia, but no overall change in the frequency or duration of feeding events. However, the blunted ghrelin response to fasting was accompanied by a marked augmentation of AHN in HAB rats.

The LAB and HAB rat lines, selectively bred for extremes in anxiety-related behaviour, provide a unique opportunity to explore anxiogenic mechanisms and the impact of anxiety-like behaviour on other physiological systems. As previously reported, HAB rats displayed a marked anxiety phenotype in the current study, none of the rats entering the open arm of the EPM. This corroborates data obtained in alternative anxiety-testing paradigms such as the open-field test, the light–dark box and the modified hole board. Similarly, the marked reduction in locomotor activity we observed has also previously been reported in this model.

Given this behavioural phenotype, the HAB rats represent a most apposite model for characterising the impact of anxiety on feeding patterns. However, since single housing is particularly anxiogenic in these animals, use of our automated feeding station was not feasible. We were, therefore, restricted to recording behavioural interactions with the food hopper in pair-housed animals. Despite this limitation, we were able to detect a mild reduction in overall food intake in HAB rats that was attributable to reduced light-phase feeding. However, this hypophagia was not accompanied by any significant change in the number or duration of individual feeding events, nor by a disruption of the diurnal feeding profile.

In the context of hypophagia, the elevated weight gain over this period of the study was surprising. While this could result from the reduced metabolic demand of inactivity (as recorded in the EPM), altered ghrelin secretion, which defends body weight in the context of insufficient nutrient supply, is an alternative explanation. However, while total ghrelin levels did not differ between HAB and LAB rats under ad libitum conditions, the fasting-induced ghrelin elevation in LAB rats was entirely suppressed in HAB rats. Interestingly, reduced circulating ghrelin has previously been reported in adolescent humans with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder which is associated with an increased risk of anxiety. The accompanying reduction in the proportion of acylated ghrelin in HAB rats implies either a reduced ghrelin O-acyl transferase activity or elevated action of de-acylating enzymes.

While the normal ghrelin levels during ad libitum feeding do not explain the faster onset of both dark-phase feeding, and light-phase satiety, the absence of a fasting-induced ghrelin response accounts for the increased feeding latency previously reported in these rats following fasting. Nevertheless, the reduction in ghrelin activity reported here would usually result in reduced weight gain and a decline in other ghrelin-dependent actions, including AHN.

Given that GHSR is highly expressed throughout the granule cell layer of the hippocampus, the action of ghrelin at GHSR is essential for ghrelin-induced AHN and is opposed by UAG, it was surprising that AHN in HAB rats was elevated in both rostral and caudal portions.

Since ghrelin stimulates corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and AVP secretion and promotes ACTH secretion directly from the corticotrophs, the failure of fasting to stimulate ghrelin secretion in HAB rats may contribute to the reversal of the corticosterone response.

In conclusion, while acute stressors suppress appetite and modify dietary selection through immediate neuroendocrine responses, we report that the chronic hyper-anxiety phenotype in male HAB rats is not accompanied by either increased meal-feeding or exacerbated grazing behaviour. However, the mild CR and elevated AHN potentially represent a homeostatic response to delayed hippocampal development and heightened anxiety (Figure 6). While elevated AHN may reflect augmented sensitivity to ghrelin, these responses are insufficient to overcome the powerful anxiogenic conditions arising from this trait-selection breeding programme.

We acknowledge that the restriction of our study to male rats represents a limitation, but we wished to address our hypothesis in the absence of the added complexities of higher AHN levels, enhanced anxiolytic response to ghrelin, altered anxiety behaviour across the oestrus cycle and reduced meal duration, especially at ovulation reported in females. In this context, whether the changes we report in males are more pronounced in females is yet to be determined. Nevertheless, while our data provide evidence of an exaggeration in the balance of diurnal feeding our study does not support the hypothesis that chronic anxiety modifies more dynamic parameters of temporal feeding behaviour.
